With our English-only culture, students shall be immersed in an environment to use the language extensively. We provide students the training and exposure to acquire the neutral English accent that are understood by all native speakers. It’s a partnership between the school and LinkPro for the benefit of the students.

<br><br>
In the grand scheme of things, students will be more prepared for the 2015 ASEAN integration which focuses on the free-flow of goods, services, and investment, in which good English communication skills play a vital role. Overall, the students become more globally competitive.
<br><br>
“They taught us a lot not only about communication skills and correct pronunciation but also to be a good person and how to boost our confidence… This is the happiest and the best training I’ve ever experienced.” Kristel Castill, CLSU, BSHRM 2015

<br><br>
“This one month of training turned out to be the start of lifelong learning as it gave me new perspective in life. My OJT experience in Linkpro is unforgettable, it exceeded my expectation.” Jefferson Ruz, CLSU, BSHRM 2015
“I’ve learned to overcome my low self-confidence, my fear to stand in front of people…I had a lot of experience: the interview, commercial workshop, charades, speeches, role playing and answering calls from native English speakers.” Rochille R. Rivera, CLSU, BSHRM 2015
